Project Title: Simple MERN Stack Todo List Application

Description:
A full-stack Todo List application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The application features a responsive and user-friendly interface with React Icons for enhanced visual feedback. The backend API is designed using Express and MongoDB, ensuring robust and scalable data handling.

    Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed with a single click, with a visual line-through effect.
    Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks permanently from the list.
    Dynamic Updates: The task list dynamically updates without requiring manual refreshes.
    Responsive UI: Modern, minimalist interface built with React and styled using CSS.
    Backend Functionality: RESTful API endpoints for task management (create, read, update, delete) using Node.js and Express.
    Database Integration: Persistent task storage powered by MongoDB.

Technologies Used:

    Frontend: React, React Icons
    Backend: Node.js, Express.js
    Database: MongoDB
    Styling: CSS
    Tools: Axios for API requests, nodemon for server monitoring

Deployment & Use Case:

This application serves as an introduction to building full-stack web applications using the MERN stack. It highlights CRUD operations, state management in React, and interaction with a RESTful API.
